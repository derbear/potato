POTATO is (almost) a Scheme interpreter written in C for fun and learning in my spare time.

Lots of TODOs:

Near-future
 * better memory management
 * better error handling
 * better error abstractions
 * better layout of code
 * documentation

Medium-future
 * legitimate hash tables
 * resizeable vector arrays
 * support for floating-point
 * file write
 * macros

Far-future
 * a working garbage collector
 * a compiler
