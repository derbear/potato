POTATO is (almost) a Scheme interpreter written in C for fun and learning in my spare time.

`make' to build
`make clean' to cleanup

`./potato' to run
`./potato [filename]' to execute a file

Long-term
 * support for floating-point
 * a working garbage collector
 * a compiler, optimizations
 * dynamic linking from top-level

Useful
 * better memory management
 * better error handling
 * better error abstractions (error type, stack-unwind)
 * better layout of code
 * documentation
 * tests
 * errors print themselves?
