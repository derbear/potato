POTATO is (almost) a Scheme interpreter written in C for fun and learning in my spare time.

`make' to build
`make clean' to cleanup
`make dist-source' to bundle all sources for distribution

`./main' to run
`./main [filename]' to execute a file

Lots of TODOs:

Near-future
 * better memory management
 * better error handling
 * better error abstractions (error type, stack-unwind)
 * better layout of code
 * documentation
 * tests

Medium-future
 * legitimate hash tables
 * resizeable vector arrays
 * support for floating-point
 * file write
 * macros

Far-future
 * a working garbage collector
 * a compiler

Bugs/problems:
 * (( is weird
